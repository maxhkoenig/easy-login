Create User and Login Interface
==========

Hello all,

This is meant for anyone who feels too overwhelmed trying to create users in a MySQL database and reference them in a php login.
For the purpose of organization, there will be no actual database used in these files, instead there will be keywords to be replaced by a database you will need to provide with your own resources.

Who is this for?

This is for the people making a php website who don't necessarily have the skills to make a user based website. Of course, anyone else is allowed to use it if they so please.
